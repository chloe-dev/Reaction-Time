        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>1. How does the assessment work?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Once started, the assessment container displays a bright red color, indicating to the user that they should
            not yet respond. After a random interval, the assessment container will display a bright green color (the
            stimulus), indicating to the user that they should respond. Responses can be given using the mouse
            (Left-Click, Right-Click, or Middle-Click) or the keyboard (Spacebar, W, A, S, D, Up Arrow, Down Arrow,
            Left Arrow, or Right Arrow).
            <br><br>
            The user repeats this sequence a total of five times to obtain an average reaction time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. What are strikes for?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Strikes are given when the user clicks before the stimulus is displayed. The three-strike system encourages
            users to respond naturally to the stimulus as opposed to anticipating or attempting to predict it. If a user
            receives three strikes in one assessment, the assessment will be invalidated, prompting the user to restart.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Does this site collect any data?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            No, and it never will. This assessment is not meant to gather statistics or provide any high-quality
            scientific value. This assessment is meant to provide users with a (mostly) accurate figure for their
            reaction time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. What is the average reaction time?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is commonly suggested that the average reaction time for humans is 250 milliseconds (0.25 seconds). This
            assessment is subject to external factors, however. A user's monitor may have a higher refresh rate than
            another user's, or perhaps the polling rate of their input device is higher. Furthermore, users on mobile
            devices will often receive notably worse averages due to higher input latency.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. What is the best setup for this assessment?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Users with higher refresh rate monitors and devices with higher polling rates tend to perform better. This
            does not, however, mean that a user with a 250 ms average reaction time will have a 150 ms reaction time
            after switching from 60 Hz to 120+ Hz.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>6. FOSS?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Yes, this assessment is Free, Open-Source Software (FOSS). A GitHub link to the repository can be found in
            the navigation bar. Feel free to report issues, create pull requests, etc.
